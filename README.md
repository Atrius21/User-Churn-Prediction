# User-Churn-Prediction
The dataset is from a e-retailer. Our objective here is to predict users would would come back in the month of November 
and attempt to retain those who were predicted to churn.

The dataset used in this analysis is uncleaned so the first half of the notebook focuses on manipulating and cleaning the data while 
the next half illustrates the modeling approach. 

I'll be using a 2 model approach ( Gradient Boosting % Random Forest ) for this kernel.
